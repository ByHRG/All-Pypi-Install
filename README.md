## Project Overview

- Why Use this?

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.6 or higher**  
2. `pip` must be available in your system or virtual environment.  

---

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ByHRG/install-all-pypi-packages.git
   cd install-all-pypi-packages
   ```

2. Ensure the main script file (`main.py`) is placed in the projectâ€™s root directory.

## Notes

1. **Resource Consumption**  
   - PyPI hosts hundreds of thousands of packages. Attempting to install them all will:
     - Generate massive network traffic  
     - Consume extensive disk space  
     - Potentially trigger dependency conflicts or build errors  

2. **Why Use This**  
   - Do Not Use This
